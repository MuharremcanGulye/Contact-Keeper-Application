# MyRepository
Full Stack MERN Application

Here My front-end codes are wrapped inside the client folder.
This application contains Context Api. Now i am learning Redux also.
In this app i have used Node.js Express.js and Mongo DB for creating API.
I have used axios to make request from UI to API.

This is my first project that i load to github. I forget to use .gitignore file.
In my next project i used .gitignore and i have removed unnecessary files.
