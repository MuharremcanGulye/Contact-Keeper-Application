# MyRepository
Full Stack MERN Application

Here My front-end codes are wrapped inside the client folder.
This application contains Context Api. Now i am learning Redux also.
In this app i have used Node.js Express.js and Mongo DB for creating API.
I have used axios to make request from UI to API.

This project has an unfinished part that is Add Contact process.
We can add contact according to logged in user's id and we can add the contact in our ContactState and database but the last added contact does not showing in UI.
After refresh the page we are able to see contact too.

If i can solve the problem i will commit the file and upload here again.
